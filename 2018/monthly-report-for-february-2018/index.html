<h2 id="project-management">Project Management</h2>

<p>This month I had to set up a couple of tools to help the team with project and
resources management. Some tools were already made available to me, so I tried
to make good use of them:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://taiga.io/">Taiga</a>, a project management platform;</li>
<li>a random wiki platform I can&rsquo;t remember the name;</li>
<li><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> for the code issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>After trying to tie every tools altogether, it all ended in a massive failure,
which made me consider using another combination of tools.</p>

<p>GitLab is fine and wasn&rsquo;t a part of the problem. I&rsquo;ve used it for every project
I&rsquo;ve been doing for the last two years, and it has integrations with pretty much
every other service. The real problem was the project management tool.</p>

<p>One constraint about the choice of the tool is that it had to be self hosted. We
are very concerned about data ownership, and we don&rsquo;t want to blindly host
everything on any third-party service. So I regretfuly had to remove all the
software as a service kind of tools from my list.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to work with <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a>
products around 2010, especially
<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a>. The impression that I had kept
was that it was a very expensive and complicated tool to setup, but also that
<strong>it wasn&rsquo;t getting in the way of my daily work</strong>. This is a very underrated
criteria when it comes to choosing the right tool for the right task, as these
days developers unfortunately tend to choose a tool depending on its hype.</p>

<p>The fact is I was wrong concerning the price of the software. Yes you have to
pay for it, but it isn&rsquo;t <strong>that</strong> expensive, especially if you has ten or less
collaborators who will use it.</p>

<p>To get a good picture of Jira, I decided to set up a
<a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> box and use the standalone evaluation
version of Jira. After a couple of installs, my environment was up and running,
and I spent the following days trying to figure if this was the good tool or
not. Let this be clear: It&rsquo;s a complicated beast to tame, and one can easily
lost themselves in the infinite number of options at every level of the
software. However, I tried to not dive into useless configuration and went
directly for the project management stuff.</p>

<p>Creating a project from scratch and populating it is a daunting task, but it&rsquo;s
made easy since there are a few projects with sample data to play around. I
toyed with the sample Scrum and Kanban projects, and came to the conclusion that
Jira was a good tool for the job: It still doesn&rsquo;t get in my way and works like
a charm out of the box.</p>

<p>There might be other tools doing some things better than others, but I didn&rsquo;t
have the time to do a complete evaluation of the gazillion project management
tools.</p>

<h2 id="software-deployment">Software Deployment</h2>

<p>After I had played with Jira on a Vagrant box, I had to deploy it on our
servers, and this is how I started playing with
<a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>. I didn&rsquo;t know much about it, but since I&rsquo;m
pretty familiar with configuration management systems –I used
<a href="https://saltstack.com/">SaltStack</a> for a couple of years–, I felt at home
pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Why not use SaltStack eh? Well, the whole IT has recently moved from
<a href="https://puppet.com/">Puppet</a> to Ansible, so I didn&rsquo;t even bother to try using
something else hehe.</p>

<p>Ansible is agent-less, making it dead easy to get it running, it has a pretty
solid documentation, and also integrates perfectly with Vagrant. After getting
started, I was able to write the complete installation process as a playbook
–the Ansible way to describe rules– in a <em>decent</em> way within a couple of hours.</p>

<p>Now I could compare these tools, but I don&rsquo;t really manage that many machines
anymore to have a relevant opinion. I&rsquo;d say Ansible fulfills my current needs
and is really faster to set up, so I&rsquo;ll stick to it for the time being. If
you&rsquo;re interested in a thorough comparison between SaltStack and Ansible,
<a href="https://medium.com/@anthonypjshaw/ansible-v-s-salt-saltstack-v-s-stackstorm-3d8f57149368">Anthony Shaw wrote a very insightful one</a>
in 2017. His analysis is perfectly neutral and helps understanding these tools.
If you&rsquo;re wondering which one you should choose, that post can be a good place
to start.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve kept doing the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/">Unity Udemy course</a> a
bit, and I made it to the item 32… of 332. Way to go!</p>
