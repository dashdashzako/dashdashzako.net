## Kibana

I spent some time working with
[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/fr/products/kibana) and trying to understand
some data inconsistency when using
[the Elasticsearch `has_parent` query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.2/query-dsl-has-parent-query.html).
For a given query using it, it was obvious not every documents were returned.
Using the same datsaset on a different Elasticsearch instance, I still had
inconsistency though the results were different.

After properly reading the dozen pages of documentation about the join queries,
I found something interesting in
[the definitive guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/parent-child.html):

> Elasticsearch maintains a map of which parents are associated with which
> children. It is thanks to this map that query-time joins are fast, but it does
> place a limitation on the parent-child relationship: the parent document and
> all of its children must live on the same shard.

This _same shard_ limitation is what I was looking for: when I inserted the
dataset, I had let Elasticsearch handle sharding. Solving my problem was rather
simple: I created a new index and reindexed my data using
[the reindex API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-reindex.html#docs-reindex)
with a specific `_routing` field parameter. a inserted the dataset again using a
custom
[routing field](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-routing-field.html#mapping-routing-field).

And inconsistency was gone.

## Web landscape

I reviewed and tested a couple of handfuls of the mainstream tools in the
JavaScript ecosystem. I was lagging a bit from the <del>hype</del> state of the
art and took some time to catch up.

That reminds me about the post
[The Front-End Spectrum by Jeff Pelletier](https://medium.com/@withinsight1/the-front-end-spectrum-c0f30998c9f0),
and how much it remains relevant even after 3 years (I could bet the same
article could have been written in 2011). Anyway, tools change, goal remains the
same: deliver reliable and high quality software.
