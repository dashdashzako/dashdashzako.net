## Web Fonts: serif or sans serif?

Until recently I didn't know much about the topic other than the aesthetics point of view. There are quite a few research papers about it, and one could spend an entire week switching from an opinion to the other. The topic is so debatable and debated that I couldn't find a definitive answer to my question.

My conclusion is that there _might_ be some benefit in using sans serif over serif typeface in a web context. However, I feel like research using more recent fonts could be useful, especially since these days no one really uses Times New Roman anymore.

* [How Serif and Sans Serif Typefaces Influence Reading on Screen: An Eye Tracking Study.](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-40355-7_55)

  > This study aims to investigate how serif and sans serif typefaces influence reading from screen. 10 graduate students voluntarily participated in the study. The data were collected in a laboratory setting. Participants were asked to find the misspelled words in two different texts written in serif and sans serif typeface. The participants tried to find the misspelled words in the texts, during the data collection there was no time limitation. Participants’ eye movements were recorded by Tobii 1750 eye tracker device. The data were analyzed according to the accuracy and eye behavior metrics. The findings showed that participants read from sans serif typeface faster and more accurate than serif typeface. The findings suggest that participants fixated on the misspelled words more on serif typeface than sans serif typeface, in terms of the total visit duration participants spent more time on serif typeface than sans serif typeface.

* [Do serifs provide an advantage in the recognition of written words?](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20445911.2011.546781)

  > A neglected issue in the literature on visual-word recognition is the careful examination of parameters such as font, size, or interletter/interword spacing on reading times. Here we analysed whether serifs (i.e., the small features at the end of strokes) play a role in lexical access. Traditionally, serif fonts have been considered easier to read than sans serif fonts, but prior empirical evidence is scarce and inconclusive. Here we conducted a lexical decision experiment (i.e., a word/nonword discrimination task) in which we compared words from the same family (Lucida) either with a serif font or with a sans serif font—in both a block list and a mixed list. Results showed a small, but significant advantage in response times for words written in a sans serif font. Thus, sans serif fonts should be the preferred choice for text in computer screens—as already is the case for guide signs on roads, trains, etc.

* [Changing Fonts in Education: How the Benefits Vary with Ability and Dyslexia](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00220671.2012.736430)

  > Previous research has shown that presenting educational materials in slightly harder to read fonts than is typical engenders deeper processing. This leads to better retention and subsequent recall of information. Before this extremely simple-to-implement and cost-effective adaptation can be made routinely to educational materials, it needs to be shown to benefit all students, or at the very least not to hinder any particular group. The authors found that students across the ability spectrum demonstrate a significant improvement in retention and recall when presented with information in a disfluent font. Significantly, those students with dyslexia are also found to greatly benefit.

  This is one of the most concise and pleasant to read articles I stumbled upon. One may agree with Alex or not, it's still written in a very high quality style.
