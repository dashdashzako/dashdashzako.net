- [Inaccessibility of {{< abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart" >}}CAPTCHA{{</ abbr >}}](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-turingtest-20180703/)

  However, there is no ideal CAPTCHA, and at some point people with disabilities
  will be unable to use it. Particular care should be brought to ensure this
  doesn't happen.
