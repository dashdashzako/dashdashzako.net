## The [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) JavaScript library

Even though this library was released in 2015, I only pay decent attention to it
now. That makes me 3 years late, but I'll live with that.

I've thoroughly followed the Tyler McGinnis Redux course, and I think that I've
got a pretty good understanding on _how_ to use Redux (this was obviously one of
the main purpose of the course), but more importantly _when_ to use it.

Yes, Redux is heavily associated with React because it was built around it, but
it can be associated with any javascript code —or library. From what I see this
tool, it is meant to be used when managing application state is a concern,
whatever the reason. For most of the small applications out there, managing
state won't become a problem until quite a long time if ever, and until that
time, using local state is a good, working solution. Using Redux from the start
will just add more boilerplate code to the application.

Redux is a really sweet helper, but it shouldn't be used blindly either. And
[so says Dan Abramov](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367),
the creator of the library.

## Accessibility related stuff

- [Inaccessibility of {{< abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart" >}}CAPTCHA{{</ abbr >}}](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-turingtest-20180703/).  
  CAPTCHAs are supposed to test whether the agent is a human or a machine.
  However, there is no ideal CAPTCHA, and at some point people with disabilities
  will be unable to use it. Particular care should be brought to ensure this
  doesn't happen.

- [The Inaccessibility of Video Players - Gian Wild](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-94277-3_9.pdf).  
  A study to determine accessible video players. Among the 37 players tested,
  only 2 passed. Way to go.

## General

- [Interface vs Type alias in TypeScript 2.7](https://medium.com/@martin_hotell/interface-vs-type-alias-in-typescript-2-7-2a8f1777af4c)

- [NPM scoped packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope).  
  While this is not a new functionnality
  ([it was discussed on GitHub in October 2014](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5239)),
  I felt like I was _just using it_ instead of really understanding it, so I
  went digging a bit further.

- [Universal Office Converter](http://dag.wiee.rs/home-made/unoconv/)
  ([source](https://github.com/dagwieers/unoconv)).  
  Convert between any document format supported by LibreOffice/OpenOffice.
  Unless it crashes.

## React and icons management in React pipeline

- [Refs and the DOM - React](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html)

- [react-icons](https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons/).  
  Looked interesting, but there are differences between original icons and the
  one provided, making it only "meh".

- [react-svg-morph](https://github.com/gorangajic/react-svg-morph/). Morph a SVG
  component into another shape.
