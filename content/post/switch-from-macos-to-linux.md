- MacOS is fine.
- Mac hardware is debatable: expensive, connectors are horrible, touchbar
  usefulness?
- At Inria, public markets with Dell. Mat was quite happy with his own, so why
  not?
- Going Windows? Not really an option, never worked with it.
- Then Linux. But which distibution?
- Everyone has their favorite one, so I'll just go for something pretty
  mainstream with KDE.
- Mapping old habits to my new home requires some time (shortcuts).
- Pros: hello OS, closer to production systems (even though you can work in
  VMs/containers anyway)
- Cons: some minor hardware issues, finitions are not as good since manufacturer
  isn't OS editor (trackpads, multiple screens pluggin/unplugging).
